In Yahtzee you have to roll 5 dices and put the dices into a category, if you
still have dices left you can roll again. You can do this up to three times.
There are two sections with different combinations to put the dice in called
the "Upper section" and the "Lower section".

Upper section:
    >Aces(1) = 1 point per dice
    >Twos(2) = 2 points per dice
    >Threes(3) = 3 points per dice
    >Fours(4) = 4 points per dice
    >Fives(5) = 5 points per dice
    >Sixes(6) = 6 points per dice

Lower section:
    >3 of a kind(3 of the same dices) = 3 of the same dice count up + the left-overs
    >4 of a kind(4 of the same dices) = 4 of the same dice count up + left-overs
    >full house(3 of the same dice + 2 of the same dice) = always 25 points
    >Small straight(for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 6) = always 30 points
    >Large straight(for example 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5) = always 40 points
    >YAHTZEE(5 of the same dices) = first yahtzee is worth 50, every yahtzee after that is 100 points
    >Chance(If you cant fill in any other box, you can use chance and fill in any combination)
